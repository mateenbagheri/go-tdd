# go-tdd
go-tdd is a repository created with the purpose of trying to grasp the concepts of TDD programming using Go.

There will be more information about this repo when I fully understand and decide where I'm taking it but for now that was all I had to say for README :)

## A RATHER IMPORTANT UPDATE
I've thought about how I want to continue trying out to learn TDD with go and I have decided to follow the path [here](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/) even though it is going to be a bit easy in the beginning.
